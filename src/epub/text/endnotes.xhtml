					<p>Galahalt or Gallehaut (<abbr>Ital.</abbr> Galeotto), a personage of the old chivalric romance of “Lancelot du Lac,” where he is described as a neighbouring king (“<i xml:lang="fr">roy doultre les marches</i>”), who, after first opposing the hero, is vanquished by him and becoming his confidant, brings about the first amorous interview between him and Guenevere; hence his name is generically used by Boccacio (following his great and favourite examplar, Dante <abbr>cf.</abbr> <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Inferno</i>, Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> l. 137, “<i xml:lang="it">Galeotto fu il libro e chi lo scrisse</i>”), for a pander, go-between or one who kindles amorous desire in women and provokes them to satisfy it. In this case he seems, by giving this surname to his book (or perhaps rather merely recording the fact that it had been so surnamed) to imply that its perusal is likely to have the same effect upon lovers or persons amorously inclined as that of the book unknown the reading of which played the Galahalt between Francesca and Paolo, loco citato. It is, however, not improbable that the words “and surnamed Prince Galahalt” may have been added by someone other than Boccaccio, although the implied reference to Dante is so much in his style and habit of thought as to make it at least probable that he was himself responsible for the addition. It may be noted, by the way, that Galahalt appears in the Morte d’Arthur, where he is always styled “<i xml:lang="fr">le haut prince</i>,” but does not figure as go-between the two lovers. <a href="proem.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>I know of no explanation of these names by the commentators, who seem, indeed, after the manner of their kind, to have generally confined themselves to the elaborate illustration and elucidation (or rather, alas! too often, obscuration) of passages already perfectly plain, leaving the difficult passages for the most part untouched. The following is the best I can make of them. <em>Pampinea</em> appears to be formed from the Greek <span xml:lang="gr">πᾶν</span>, all, and <span xml:lang="gr">πινύω</span>, I advise, admonish or inform, and to mean all-advising or admonishing, which would agree well enough with the character of Pampinea, who is represented as the eldest and sagest of the female personages of the Decameron and as taking the lead in everything. <em>Fiammetta</em> is the name by which Boccaccio designates his mistress, the Princess Maria of Naples (the lady for whom he cherished “the very high and noble passion” of which he speaks in his Proem), in his earlier opuscule, the “<i xml:lang="it">Elégia di Madonna Fiammetta</i>,” describing, in her name, the torments of separation from the beloved. In this work he speaks of himself under the name of Pamfilo (Gr. <span xml:lang="gr">πᾶν</span>, all, and <span xml:lang="gr">φιλέω</span>, I love, <abbr class="initialism">i.e.</abbr> the all-loving or the passionate lover), and it is probable, therefore, that under these names he intended to introduce his royal ladylove and himself in the present work. <em>Filomena</em> (Italian form of Philomela, a nightingale, Greek <span xml:lang="gr">φίλος</span> loving, and <span xml:lang="gr">μελός</span>, melody, song, <abbr class="initialism">i.e.</abbr> song-loving) is perhaps so styled for her love of music, and <em>Emilia’s</em> character, as it appears in the course of the work, justifies the derivation of her name from the Greek <span xml:lang="gr">αἱμύλιος</span>, pleasing, engaging in manners and behaviour, cajoling. <em>Lauretta</em> Boccaccio probably intends us to look upon as a learned lady, if, as we may suppose, her name is a corruption of <i xml:lang="it">laureata</i>, laurel-crowned; whilst <em>Neifile’s</em> name (Greek <span xml:lang="gr">νεῖος</span> [<span xml:lang="gr">νεός</span>] new, and <span xml:lang="gr">φιλέω</span>, I love, <abbr class="initialism">i.e.</abbr> novelty-loving) stamps her as being of a somewhat curious disposition, eager “to tell or to hear some new thing.” The name <em>Elisa</em> is not so easily to be explained as the others; possibly it was intended by the author as a reminiscence of Dido, to whom the name (which is by some authorities explained to mean “Godlike,” from a Hebrew root) is said to have been given “<i xml:lang="la">quòd plurima supra animi muliebris fortitudinem gesserit</i>.” It does not, however, appear that there was in Elisa’s character or life anything to justify the implied comparison. <a href="day-1-introduction.xhtml#noteref-17" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-18" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This phrase may also be read “persuading themselves that that (<abbr class="initialism">i.e.</abbr> their breach of the laws of obedience, <abbr>etc.</abbr>) beseemeth them and is forbidden only to others” (<i xml:lang="it">faccendosi a credere che quello a lor si convenga e non si disdica che all’ altre</i>); but the reading in the text appears more in harmony with the general sense and is indeed indicated by the punctuation of the Giunta Edition of 1527, which I generally follow in case of doubt. <a href="day-1-introduction.xhtml#noteref-18" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><em>Filostrato</em>, Greek <span xml:lang="gr">φίλος</span>, loving, and <span xml:lang="gr">στρατὸς</span>, army, metaphorically strife, war, <abbr class="initialism">i.e.</abbr> one who loves strife. This name appears to be a reminiscence of Boccaccio’s poem (“Il Filostrato,” well known through its translation by Chaucer and the Senechal d’Anjou) upon the subject of the loves of Troilus and Cressida and to be in this instance used by him as a synonym for an unhappy lover, whom no rebuffs, no treachery can divert from his ill-starred passion. Such a lover may well be said to be in love with strife, and that the Filostrato of the Decameron sufficiently answers to this description we learn later on from his own lips. <a href="day-1-introduction.xhtml#noteref-21" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><abbr class="initialism">I.e.</abbr> nine o’clock <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> Boccaccio’s habit of measuring time by the canonical hours has been a sore stumbling-block to the ordinary English and French translator, who is generally terribly at sea as to his meaning, inclining to render <i xml:lang="it">tierce</i> three, <i xml:lang="it">sexte</i> six o’clock and <i xml:lang="it">none</i> noon and making shots of the same wild kind at the other hours. The monasterial rule (which before the general introduction of clocks was commonly followed by the medieval public in the computation of time) divided the twenty-four hours of the day and night into seven parts (six of three hours each and one of six), the inception of which was denoted by the sound of the bells that summoned the clergy to the performance of the seven canonical offices <abbr class="initialism">i.e.</abbr> <em>Matins</em> at 3 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr>, <em>Prime</em> at 6 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr>, <em>Tierce</em> at 9 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr>, <em>Sexte</em> or Noonsong at noon, <em>None</em> at 3 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr>, <em>Vespers</em> or Evensong at 6 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr> and <em>Complines</em> or Nightsong at 9 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr>, and at the same time served the laity as a clock. <a href="day-1-introduction.xhtml#noteref-25" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

It is difficult, however, in this instance as in many others, to discover with certainty Boccaccio’s exact meaning, owing to his affectation of Ciceronian concision and delight in obscure elliptical forms of construction; whilst his use of words in a remote or unfamiliar sense and the impossibility of deciding, in certain cases, the person of the pronouns and adjectives employed tend still farther to darken counsel. <abbr class="initialism">e.g.</abbr>, if we render <i xml:lang="it">affezione</i> sentiment, <i xml:lang="it">cognobbe</i> (as <i xml:lang="it">riconobbe</i>) acknowledged, recognized, and read <i xml:lang="it">le sue parole</i> as meaning <em>her</em> (instead of <em>his</em>) words, the whole sense of the passage is changed, and we must read it “more by her sentiment (<abbr class="initialism">i.e.</abbr> by the tendency and spirit of her story) recognized the inclination of her companions than that of the king by her [actual] words.” I have commented thus at large on this passage, in order to give my readers some idea of the difficulties which at every page beset the translator of the Decameron and which make Boccaccio perhaps the most troublesome of all authors to render into representative English. <a href="day-4-2.xhtml#noteref-226" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
